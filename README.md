### Algorithmic Thinking for Software Engineering Interviews

A **pattern-based study repository** dedicated to **algorithms and data structures**,
designed to build strong **problem-solving and interview reasoning skills**.

This project focuses on **how to think**, not just how to code.

---

## 📌 Solution Template

Every problem follows the same structure to mirror real interview explanations:
- **Problem** – concise problem description
- **Pattern** – the algorithmic pattern applied
- **Intuition** – how to recognize the pattern
- **Approach** – step-by-step reasoning
- **Complexity** – time and space analysis
- **Code** – clean, interview-ready implementation
This format prioritizes clarity of thought over clever tricks.

## ☕ Primary Language
- Java (main language)
  
Focus areas:
- Algorithms
- Data Structures
- Readable, maintainable, interview-style code
No frameworks. No shortcuts. Fundamentals only.

---

## 🧪 Study Philosophy
````
Don’t memorize problems.
Learn to recognize patterns.
````
The goal is to reach a point where you can confidently say:

- “This is a Sliding Window problem.”
- “This requires BFS, not DFS.”
- “This problem needs Dynamic Programming.”

This mindset is what interviewers look for.

## 🎯 Purpose

Coding interviews are not about memorizing solutions.

They are about:
- Recognizing algorithmic patterns
- Explaining your reasoning clearly
- Understanding trade-offs
- Writing clean, efficient code under pressure

This repository exists to practice **interview-ready algorithmic thinking** using a
structured, repeatable approach.

---

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository
- Study one pattern at a time
- Re-implement solutions without looking
- Practice explaining your approach out loud
- Focus on reasoning, not speed
- Treat every problem as a mock interview
This repository is meant to be used actively, not passively read.

## 📚 References & Inspiration

This repository is primarily inspired by the following books:

- Coding Interview Patterns: Nail Your Next Coding Interview (2024) | Xu A.
  - A pattern-based approach to solving coding interview problems.

- Silicon Valley Python Engineer Interview Guide: Data Structure, Algorithm, and System Design | Jianfeng Ren, Andric Li
  - Interview mindset, algorithmic depth, and system design foundations.

Concepts and patterns are adapted and implemented in Java, with a strong emphasis on
interview communication and reasoning.

## 📍 Disclaimer

This repository is a personal study playbook for algorithm and interview preparation.
It reflects my learning journey and interpretation of common interview patterns.

Solutions are written for educational and interview preparation purposes only.

## 🧠 Repository Structure

Problems are organized by **algorithmic patterns**, not by platform or problem IDs.
